# Gradle Changelog Plugin

A Gradle plugin which writes a markdown formatted changelog file based on conventional changelog syntax git commits.

## Conventional Changelog

Conventional Changelog is a commit convention defined and used by AngularJS. It aims at producing more usefull changelogs trimming unimportant commits out of the changelog.
For this purpose a set of simple and easy to use conventions are used. The full commit convention can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/ "AngularJS Git Commit Message Conventions")

## Basic Usage

Add the plugin to your `buildscript`'s `dependencies` section:

```groovy
classpath 'com.github.marcpoppleton:git-changelog:0.1.3'
```

Apply the `changelog` plugin:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'changelog'
```

Commit using the conventional changelog convention and call the `changelog` Gradle task!

## Configuration

Configuration of the `changelog` task is optionnal, if none is provided the defaults settings will be used. Default values are detailed below.

```groovy
changelog {
    //the name of the file where to write the changelog.
    file “CHANGELOG.md” //Defaults to "CHANGELOG.md"
    
    //the name of the app/project for which you are generating a changelog.
    appName “gradle-changelog-plugin” //Defaults to an empty string.
